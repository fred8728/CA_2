# CA2 project
- This readme file is for the CA2 project which will be a big part the documentation of this project.
- For the following project there has been worked on using the learned
  material from this flow to make a SPA which uses a REST-API to get data
  from a JPA. There was other things as error handling and such.
  
- for this project there have been a lot of work to complete, which
  have resulted in only being able to make the basic conditions for
  this project with not much space for implementing more advanced things.
  
- There are two folders in this project, one for the SPA 
  and the other for the REST-API where the DTO is created.<br>
